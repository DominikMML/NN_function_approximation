# Neural Network Function Approximation
This repository contains a Python project for approximating mathematical functions using neural networks. The project demonstrates how to construct, train, and evaluate a neural network model to approximate various mathematical functions, showcasing the capabilities of neural networks in function approximation tasks.

## Overview
The main goal of this project is to explore the use of neural networks for approximating functions. By training a neural network on a set of input-output pairs, the model learns to approximate the underlying function that maps inputs to outputs. 

## Features
- **Customizable Neural Network Architecture**: Design neural networks with different architectures to approximate various functions.
- **Function Approximation Examples**: Includes examples of approximating different mathematical functions (e.g., sine, cosine, polynomial functions).
- **Visualization**: Visualize the approximation results using matplotlib to see how well the neural network has learned the function.
- **Loss and Training Metrics**: Track training progress with loss curves and metrics.

### Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
